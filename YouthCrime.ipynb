    "## Background and Introduction\n",
    "Youth crime is a pressing issue recently in Australia that directly affects the safety of communities. As the offences committed by juveniles happened frequently, people's concerns about the safety of life and property are increasing. In Figure 1, it shows the number of youth crime related news published by The Guardian in each month since 2021, it can be observed that the number is increasing since 2022 generally. \n",
    "\n",
    "As society pays more and more attention to the issue of youth crime, policymakers can play a significant role in solving this problem. The purpose of this research is to produce a comprehensive understanding of the most common types of offences committed by juveniles and the trends in local areas. By analysing this data, policymakers can develop targeted strategies and policies to address the issue effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Ethics: Using the actual numbers of the news published to support that the concern is not personal feeling.\n",
    "- Reason for choosing the topic: Although the growing concern about youth crime in society, there are no indications that it is decreasing. It can still be seen that robbery or other offences of youth crime occurred frequently reveal by the news. That can be considered an urgent issue that needs to be solved."

    "## General Question:\n",
    "How youth crime has changed over time in different local areas in Queensland? Additionally, are there certain types of offences that occur more frequently among youth compared to adults, and do these patterns differ in different local areas?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Purpose: By answering this question, a comprehensive understanding of the temporal trends and changes in youth crime, and the specific offence types prevalent among youth crime can be concluded. This information can assist policymakers and communities in developing targeted interventions and strategies to address youth crime in different local areas.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Ethics: Before answering this question, it is important to analyse all areas thoroughly, rather than just focusing on certain areas that may be got more concern. There are no assumptions here.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Intended Audience: This can be everyone, not only the Queenslanders. This issue is not limited to a specific country, and therefore, the analysis findings can be shared with the world as valuable reference information.\n"

    "## Major Data Source\n",
    "1. Queensland Police provide various open data on their [Maps and Statistics webpage](https://www.police.qld.gov.au/maps-and-statistics). For this research, the offences data including location information and offences type are needed. Furthermore, the information about whether the offenders are juveniles is also important. Therefore, `LGA Reported offenders number`, the dataset includes the major information we need, be selected as the data source .\n",
    "\n",
    "2. To understand the variation between local areas, visualisation can be important. Australian Government provides open data `QLD Local Government Areas - PSMA Administrative Boundaries GeoJSON(GEOJSON)` show the geographic information of each local govcernment in `GeoJSON file` on [data.gov.au](https://data.gov.au/dataset/ds-dga-16803f0b-6934-41ae-bf82-d16265784c7f/details?q=Queensland%20LGA%20boundaries).\n",
    "\n",
    "- Ethics: The data contain all crime data in Queensland, including all sex, age, and all types of offences.\n",
    "- Source: All the data are from the government and all open data. \n",
    "- Limitations: The crime data show the crime detail to local areas, not suburbs or even streets. The crime data did not show the date of a specific time. It is limited to local areas and monthly data from January 2001 to April 2023. \n",
    "- Quality: All data quality is well with good columns name and no null data.\n",
    "- Amount: There are 125424 rows of data with 89 kinds of offences and 78 local areas.\n"

    "Based on the analysis of youth crime over time in different local areas in Queensland, several key insights can be found. Overall, youth crime has not risen significantly or grown faster than adult crimes in the past two decades. However, the recent data in 2022 indicates a noticeable rise in youth crime (11% increase) compared to adult crime (3.7% increase) in the same year, it is being suggested that youth crime is becoming a growing concern in Queensland recently.\n",
    "\n",
    "When analysing monthly data from 2022, there is no significant difference in growth between youth and adult crime. However, the youth crime cases decreased by 24% in Feb 2023, but it increased by 25% in the next month Mar 2023. Compared to adult crime, the growth rates are -3% and +5% in Feb 2023 and Mar 2023, respectively. It can be concluded that the youth crime data shows more variation in a monthly crime increasing rate compared to the adult group. \n",
    "\n",
    "Analysing youth crime across all local areas in Queensland reveals some specific areas had a significant increase. Cairns stands out as an area where youth crime has significantly increased, with similar trends observed in neighboring areas like Douglas, Mareeba, and Tablelands, although the growth rate was not as high as in Cairns. Additionally, some areas such as Mackay, Sunshine Coast, and Toowoomba have experienced a medium degree increasing in youth crime.\n",
    "\n",
    "In terms of offence types, there are five common offences shared between youth and adult crime: Other offences, Offences Against Property, Other Theft (excluding Unlawful Entry), Offences Against the Person, and Drug Offences. However, offences related to unlawful entry, including Unlawful Entry, Unlawful Entry With Intent - Dwelling, and Unlawful Entry Without Violence - Dwelling are more prevalent in youth crime compared to adult crime. The offence of Unlawful Use of Motor Vehicle is also more common among youth. On the other hand, drug-related offences, such as Drug Offences and Other Drug Offences, are less common in youth crime compared to adult crime.\n",
    "\n",
    "By analysing all the offence types in different local areas allows clustering into three groups: Group 0, Group 1, and Group 2. Group 0 has significantly fewer offences compared to the other two groups. Group 1 and Group 2 share some common offence types, including Offences Against Property, Other Offences, and Other Property Damage. However, Group 1 is more focused on property-related offences, such as Unlawful Entry With Intent - Other and Unlawful Entry With Intent - Dwelling. In contrast, Group 2 shows a broader range of offence types, including property-related crimes, Assault, and drug offences.\n",
    "\n",
    "In conclusion, the analysis result indicates that youth crime in Queensland has shown some significant increase in specific months or particular areas but not in general over time. However, there is no sign showing that youth crime is mitigating. To plan more interventions on it can be necessary. Secondly, certain offence types, such as unlawful entry and motor vehicle-related offences, are more prevalent among youth. Local areas like Cairns, along with other regions such as Douglas, Mareeba, and Tablelands, have experienced notable increases in youth crime recently. These insights can inform policymakers and communities in developing targeted interventions and strategies to mitigate youth crime in different local areas. Furthermore, it can be based on the area groups to plan different policies and the local governments can share some experience with the other local councils who are in the same group. Based on the result of the analysis, these policies' direction can be helpful for address this growing concern issue. \n"
